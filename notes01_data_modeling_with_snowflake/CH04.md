# Chapter 4: Mastering Snowflake Objects

**Topics covered in this chapter:**

- `stage` and `file_format` objects used for loading data into Snowflake
- The various physical `table` types used to store data
- `metadata_table` for reviewing staged files
- `view` and associated cost and performance benefits
- `materialized_view` and when to use them
- `stream` for data change tracking
- `task` for automating continuous ETL pipelines

## Stages [`stage`]

- **Stages** are logical objects in Snowflake that abstract cloud filesystems for data loading.
 
- There are two types of stages: **external** and **internal**.
 
- **External stages** are created on top of a cloud location outside Snowflake and are used to load data from external source systems.
 
- **Internal stages** are created within the Snowflake account and are used to stage files that originate from within the Snowflake account.
 
- Supported cloud storage services for external stages include **Amazon S3 buckets**, **Google Cloud Storage buckets**, and **Microsoft Azure containers**.
 
- Stages can store any type of file, but only certain structured and semi-structured file types are supported for loading data into Snowflake.

- A file format must be specified when accessing data from a stage for subsequent loading into a Snowflake table.

## File Formats [`file_format`]

- A file format defines properties such as the **delimiter type**, **date/time formats**, and **encoding**.
- Snowflake supports several structured and semi-structured file formats, such as **CSV**, **JSON**, and **Parquet**.
- Users can create their own named file formats when loading or unloading files of a specified type.
- File format properties can also be specified at runtime when using the **COPY INTO** command.
